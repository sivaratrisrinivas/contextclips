# Context Clips - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Can't copy items when clicked on Ctrl+C
**Problem:** Users could only copy clips by clicking on them, but keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C didn't work.

**Solution:**
- Added keyboard event listener in the sidepanel App component
- Implemented clip selection state to track which clip is selected
- Added visual feedback for selected clips (blue border and ring)
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts:
  - **Ctrl+C / Cmd+C**: Copy the selected clip to clipboard
  - **Enter**: Copy the selected clip to clipboard
  - **Arrow Up/Down**: Navigate through clips
  - **Delete**: Remove the selected clip

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/sidepanel/App.tsx` - Added keyboard handling, selection state, and navigation
- `/app/src/sidepanel/components/ClipCard.tsx` - Added selection visual feedback

### 2. ✅ Not able to see clip items in the sidepanel
**Problem:** Clips were not appearing in the sidepanel after being copied.

**Solution:**
- Added real-time update listener to refresh clips when new ones are captured
- Implemented message broadcasting from background script when new clips are added
- Ensured proper initialization of the database connection
- Added proper error handling and logging throughout the data flow

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/sidepanel/App.tsx` - Added message listener for `CLIP_ADDED` events
- `/app/src/background/service-worker.ts` - Added broadcast message when clips are added

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Content Script captures copy events → 
2. Reads clipboard content → 
3. Sends to Background Service Worker → 
4. Background saves to IndexedDB → 
5. Background broadcasts to Sidepanel → 
6. Sidepanel updates UI

### State Management
- Clips are stored in IndexedDB for persistence
- Sidepanel maintains local state for performance
- Real-time updates via Chrome message passing API
