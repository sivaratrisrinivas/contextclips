# Context Clips - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Can't copy items when clicked on Ctrl+C
**Problem:** Users could only copy clips by clicking on them, but keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C didn't work.

**Solution:**
- Added keyboard event listener in the sidepanel App component
- Implemented clip selection state to track which clip is selected
- Added visual feedback for selected clips (blue border and ring)
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts:
  - **Ctrl+C / Cmd+C**: Copy the selected clip to clipboard
  - **Enter**: Copy the selected clip to clipboard
  - **Arrow Up/Down**: Navigate through clips
  - **Delete**: Remove the selected clip

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/sidepanel/App.tsx` - Added keyboard handling, selection state, and navigation
- `/app/src/sidepanel/components/ClipCard.tsx` - Added selection visual feedback

### 2. ✅ Not able to see clip items in the sidepanel
**Problem:** Clips were not appearing in the sidepanel after being copied.

**Root Cause:** IndexedDB transaction race condition - the database was resolving promises on `request.onsuccess` instead of waiting for `transaction.oncomplete`, causing queries to execute before write transactions were fully committed.

**Solution:**
- Fixed IndexedDB transaction handling to wait for `transaction.oncomplete` instead of `request.onsuccess`
- This ensures write operations are fully committed before subsequent reads
- Added real-time update listener to refresh clips when new ones are captured
- Implemented message broadcasting from background script when new clips are added
- Ensured proper initialization of the database connection
- Added proper error handling and logging throughout the data flow

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/lib/db.ts` - Fixed transaction completion handling in all database methods
- `/app/src/sidepanel/App.tsx` - Added message listener for `CLIP_ADDED` events
- `/app/src/background/service-worker.ts` - Added broadcast message when clips are added

## New Features Added

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Users can now use the following keyboard shortcuts in the sidepanel:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C` | Copy selected clip |
| `Enter` | Copy selected clip |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate through clips |
| `Delete` | Remove selected clip |

### Visual Improvements
- Selected clips now have a blue border and ring for clear visual feedback
- Added keyboard shortcuts hint at the top of the sidepanel
- Improved user experience with better navigation

## How to Test

1. **Install the extension:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `/app/dist` folder
   - **IMPORTANT**: After loading, click "Reload" button to refresh the extension

2. **Test copying:**
   - Open any website
   - Select and copy some text (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
   - The text should be captured in the extension

3. **Test sidepanel viewing:**
   - Click the extension icon to open the sidepanel
   - You should see all your copied clips immediately

4. **Test keyboard shortcuts:**
   - In the sidepanel, use arrow keys to navigate
   - Press Enter or Ctrl+C to copy the selected clip
   - Press Delete to remove a clip

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Content Script captures copy events → 
2. Reads clipboard content → 
3. Sends to Background Service Worker → 
4. Background saves to IndexedDB (waits for transaction completion) → 
5. Background broadcasts to Sidepanel → 
6. Sidepanel updates UI

### Database Transaction Fix
**Before:** Promise resolved on `request.onsuccess` (premature)
```javascript
request.onsuccess = () => {
  resolve() // Transaction might not be committed yet!
}
```

**After:** Promise resolved on `transaction.oncomplete` (correct)
```javascript
transaction.oncomplete = () => {
  resolve() // Transaction fully committed
}
```

This ensures that when `addClip()` completes, the data is guaranteed to be visible to subsequent `getAllClips()` calls.

### State Management
- Clips are stored in IndexedDB for persistence
- Sidepanel maintains local state for performance
- Real-time updates via Chrome message passing API
