# Context Clips - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Can't copy items when clicked on Ctrl+C
**Problem:** Users could only copy clips by clicking on them, but keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C didn't work.

**Solution:**
- Added keyboard event listener in the sidepanel App component
- Implemented clip selection state to track which clip is selected
- Added visual feedback for selected clips (blue border and ring)
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts:
  - **Ctrl+C / Cmd+C**: Copy the selected clip to clipboard
  - **Enter**: Copy the selected clip to clipboard
  - **Arrow Up/Down**: Navigate through clips
  - **Delete**: Remove the selected clip

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/sidepanel/App.tsx` - Added keyboard handling, selection state, and navigation
- `/app/src/sidepanel/components/ClipCard.tsx` - Added selection visual feedback

### 2. ‚úÖ Not able to see clip items in the sidepanel
**Problem:** Clips were not appearing in the sidepanel after being copied.

**Root Cause:** **Database Context Isolation** - Chrome extensions isolate IndexedDB storage between different contexts (service worker vs sidepanel). Each context had its own separate IndexedDB instance, so clips written by the service worker were invisible to the sidepanel.

**Solution:**
- **Replaced IndexedDB with `chrome.storage.local` API**
- `chrome.storage.local` is specifically designed for Chrome extensions
- Storage is automatically shared across ALL extension contexts (service worker, sidepanel, popup, content scripts)
- Persists across service worker restarts
- Simpler, more reliable, and the recommended approach for Chrome extensions
- Added real-time update listener to refresh clips when new ones are captured
- Implemented message broadcasting from background script when new clips are added

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/lib/db.ts` - **Complete rewrite** to use chrome.storage.local instead of IndexedDB
- `/app/src/sidepanel/App.tsx` - Added message listener for `CLIP_ADDED` events
- `/app/src/background/service-worker.ts` - Added broadcast message when clips are added

## New Features Added

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Users can now use the following keyboard shortcuts in the sidepanel:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C` | Copy selected clip |
| `Enter` | Copy selected clip |
| `‚Üë` / `‚Üì` | Navigate through clips |
| `Delete` | Remove selected clip |

### Visual Improvements
- Selected clips now have a blue border and ring for clear visual feedback
- Added keyboard shortcuts hint at the top of the sidepanel
- Improved user experience with better navigation

## How to Test

1. **CRITICAL: Reload the extension:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Find "Context Clips" extension
   - Click the **üîÑ circular reload button** on the extension card
   - This is different from refreshing - you MUST reload the extension!

2. **Test copying:**
   - Open any website
   - Select and copy some text (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
   - The text should be captured in the extension

3. **Test sidepanel viewing:**
   - Click the extension icon to open the sidepanel
   - You should see all your copied clips immediately

4. **Test keyboard shortcuts:**
   - In the sidepanel, use arrow keys to navigate
   - Press Enter or Ctrl+C to copy the selected clip
   - Press Delete to remove a clip

## Technical Details

### Why chrome.storage.local?

**Before (IndexedDB):**
- ‚ùå Service worker has its own IndexedDB
- ‚ùå Sidepanel has its own IndexedDB
- ‚ùå Data not shared between contexts
- ‚ùå Service worker restarts lose database connection

**After (chrome.storage.local):**
- ‚úÖ Single shared storage across all contexts
- ‚úÖ Designed specifically for Chrome extensions
- ‚úÖ Persists across service worker lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Simpler API, no transactions needed
- ‚úÖ Automatically synchronized

### Data Flow
1. Content Script captures copy events ‚Üí 
2. Reads clipboard content ‚Üí 
3. Sends to Background Service Worker ‚Üí 
4. Background saves to chrome.storage.local ‚Üí 
5. Background broadcasts to Sidepanel ‚Üí 
6. Sidepanel queries chrome.storage.local (same storage!) ‚Üí 
7. Sidepanel updates UI

### Storage Implementation
```javascript
// Add clip
await chrome.storage.local.set({ clips: [...clips, newClip] })

// Get all clips
const result = await chrome.storage.local.get('clips')
const clips = result.clips || []
```

Simple, reliable, and works across all contexts!
