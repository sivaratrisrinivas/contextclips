# Documentation Assets

This directory contains documentation assets for the Context Clips project.

## Screenshot

To add the screenshot to this directory:

1. Save your screenshot as `screenshot.png` in this directory
2. The screenshot should show the Context Clips sidepanel interface
3. Recommended: Show the extension with some captured clips to demonstrate functionality

Current screenshot should show:
- The minimalist sidepanel interface
- Domain filtering pills (e.g., "All", "fs.blog", "posthog.com")
- Search bar
- Sample clips with metadata (domain, timestamp, page title)
- The clean, content-first design

## Adding Screenshots

To add the screenshot from your system:
```bash
# Navigate to the docs directory
cd contextclips/docs

# Copy your screenshot (adjust path as needed)
cp /path/to/your/screenshot.png screenshot.png
```

Or manually save the screenshot to: `contextclips/docs/screenshot.png`
