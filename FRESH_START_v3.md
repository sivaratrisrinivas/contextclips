### Step 2: Clear Cache

### Step 4: Verify v3.0 is Running
1. Click on **"Service Worker"** link under the extension
2. You should see in console:
   ```
   🚀 SERVICE WORKER v3.0 STARTED
   ```
   **If you see anything else, the old code is still cached!**

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Copy Text
1. Go to any webpage (e.g., https://example.com)
2. Select some text
3. Copy it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
4. In service worker console, you should see:
   ```
   📨 Message: SAVE_CLIP
   ✅ Saved clip. Total: 1
   ```

### Test 2: View in Sidepanel

2. Sidepanel should open
3. In sidepanel console (right-click → Inspect), you should see:
   ```
   📊 Loaded X clips
   ```
4. Your copied text should be visible!

### Test 3: Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Arrow Up/Down**: Navigate between clips

- **Delete**: Remove selected clip

## ✨ Features

### What Works:
✅ Copy text from any webpage  
✅ Clips appear in sidepanel instantly  
✅ Keyboard navigation  
✅ Dark modern UI  
✅ Delete clips  
✅ Shows domain and time  

### Simplified (Removed):
- ❌ No content type detection (kept simple)
- ❌ No pinning (kept simple)  
- ❌ No search (maybe add later)
- ❌ No filters (maybe add later)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Old logs still showing
**Solution:** Extension cache is persistent. Try:
1. Remove extension completely
2. Restart Chrome
3. Load extension again

### Issue: Clips not saving
**Check service worker console:**
- Should see: `🚀 SERVICE WORKER v3.0 STARTED`
- When copying: Should see `✅ Saved clip`

### Issue: Sidepanel empty
**Check sidepanel console:**
- Should see: `📊 Loaded X clips`
- If shows 0 clips but you copied text, storage isn't working

### Nuclear Option (if nothing works):
```bash
# Close Chrome completely
# Delete extension cache (on Mac):
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/

# On Windows:
# Delete: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\

# On Linux:
rm -rf ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/

# Restart Chrome and load extension fresh
```

## 📊 File Structure

```
/app/src/
├── types/
│   └── index.ts              # Type definitions
├── background/
│   ├── storage.ts            # Storage layer (chrome.storage.local)
│   └── service-worker.ts     # Background worker

└── sidepanel/
    ├── index.html            # Sidepanel entry

    ├── App.tsx               # Main app component
    └── styles.css            # Styles
```

## 🎨 Architecture

**Simple message flow:**
1. User copies text on webpage
2. Content script captures it
3. Sends to service worker  
4. Service worker saves to chrome.storage.local
5. Service worker broadcasts update
6. Sidepanel receives update and refreshes

**Storage:**
- Uses `chrome.storage.local` with key `clips_v3`
- Simple array of clips
- No complex transactions or contexts

## ✅ Success Criteria

Extension is working correctly if:
1. Service worker shows v3.0 startup message
2. Copying text shows "Saved clip" message
3. Sidepanel displays copied clips
4. Keyboard shortcuts work
5. Can delete clips

## 🚀 Next Steps (If Requested)

Possible enhancements:
- Search functionality
- Content type detection
- Pin important clips
- Export/import clips
- Sync across devices
